The dataLayer is a Javascript object that bring data from the backend to the frontend when user make any interaction with the site through the browser such as loading or clicking
on any elements

Example:

<script>
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
window.dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'userLogin',
  'userId': 12345
}); 
</script>

One of the most popular cases which dataLayers have an important role is setting up enchanced ecommerce tracking for a storefront. This specific implementation require the 
dataLayers follow certain structures and the values in each key need to be consistent throughout the shopping funnel.

In Ruukki case, at the beginning of the project, we want to analyze user groups and how they interact with the order process between ecom site and RCT site. So the dataLayer below
should be populated when users log in to their accounts in ecom.ruukki.com, and when they land to RCT site.


<script>
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
window.dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'userLogin',
  'userId': 12345,
  'userType': 'saleman'
}); 
</script>

For implementing Enhanced Ecommerce tracking, it requires specific syntaxt for the objects pushed to dataLayers. That is quite a heavy setup so we save if for later when
we get the deal with the client.
